@inproceedings{2012-Aalst,
	abstract = {Process mining techniques are able to extract knowledge from event logs commonly available in today's information systems. These techniques provide new means to discover, monitor, and improve processes in a variety of application domains. There are two main drivers for the growing interest in process mining. On the one hand, more and more events are being recorded, thus, providing detailed information about the history of processes. On the other hand, there is a need to improve and support business processes in competitive and rapidly changing environments. This manifesto is created by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining and aims to promote the topic of process mining. Moreover, by defining a set of guiding principles and listing important challenges, this manifesto hopes to serve as a guide for software developers, scientists, consultants, business managers, and end-users. The goal is to increase the maturity of process mining as a new tool to improve the (re)design, control, and support of operational business processes.},

There are about 1000 cases with in total 15,000 events that were recorded for 16 different activities. Moreover, 39 data attributes are recorded, e.g., the group responsible for the activity, the results of tests and information from checklists. Events and attribute values have been anonymized. The time stamps of events have been randomized, but the time between events within a trace has not been altered.},

	abstract = {Contemporary process discovery methods take as inputs only positive examples of process executions, and so they are one-class classification algorithms. However, we have found negative examples to also be available in industry, hence we propose to treat process discovery as a binary classification problem. This approach opens the door to many well-established methods and metrics from machine learning, in particular to improve the distinction between what should and should not be allowed by the output model. Concretely, we (1) present a formalisation of process discovery as a binary classification problem; (2) provide cases with negative examples from industry, including real-life logs; (3) propose the Rejection Miner binary classification procedure, applicable to any process notation that has a suitable syntactic composition operator; and (4) apply this miner to the real world logs obtained from our industry partner, showing increased output model quality in terms of accuracy and model size.},
