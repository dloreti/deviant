\begin{abstract}
As the need to understand and formalise business processes into a model has grown over the last years, 
the process discovery research field has gained more and more importance, developing two different classes of approaches to model representation: procedural and declarative. 
%
Orthogonally to this classification, the vast majority of works envisage the discovery task as a one-class supervised learning process guided by the traces that are recorded into an input log. 

In this work instead, we focus on declarative processes and embrace the less-popular view of process discovery as a binary supervised learning task, where the input log reports both examples of the normal system execution, and traces representing ``stranger'' behaviours according to the domain semantics. We therefore deepen how the valuable information brought by both these two sets can be extracted and formalised into a model that is ``optimal'' according to user-defined goals. Our approach, namely \nd, is evaluated w.r.t. other relevant works in this field, and shows promising results as regards both the performance and the quality of the obtained solution.

% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the

% not be used in maketitle, but will appear (i.e., to be "transported")
% here as \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext when the compsoc 
% or transmag modes are not selected <OR> if conference mode is selected 
% - because all conference papers position the abstract like regular
% papers do.

% \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext has no effect when using

% \IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}
% % Computer Society journal (but not conference!) papers do something unusual

% % They place it ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls does not automatically do
% % this for you, but you can achieve this effect with the provided
% % \IEEEraisesectionheading{} command. Note the need to keep any \label that
% % is to refer to the section immediately after \section in the above as
% % \IEEEraisesectionheading puts \section within a raised box.

% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
% for IEEE Computer Society journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
% IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later.
